# Azure DevOps Course

This a repository which contains course files for Niels's Azure DevOps classes.

These courses are assignment which you can complete in your own lab. Normally I would be in a room with the people that follow the course but if you are up for the challenge, please follow the instructions and completed the builds.


## Using the course


Please start by exploring the preparation folder. This contains the prequisites and the instructions to prepare your machine for this course.

After that you can start with building course 1 and after that course 2 etc..

Each course contains a Read.me file which explains the objective of the course.
